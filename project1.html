<p class="b">
Today is November 21. It's a special day. It's a thrilling day. I have done a thing that is very difficult to me. 
 I am now exhausted. In the noon, I was overwhelmed by my unstable emotions. Tears fell off my face. At that time, I  really anxious. 
  I feared that I couldn't make it. The condition is not what I expected. I felt anxious and  was struggled to talk and made decisions.
